# Automated-Legal-Entity
This is a repository for the creation of an Automated Legal Entity (ALE)


This initially exists to answer the questions:

What are the components of an ALE?

What are the inputs and outputs of an ALE?

How do the internal mechanisms of an ALE function?


The core team can work on the master branch until an agreed upon time when they will migrate to their own branches.
